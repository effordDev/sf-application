This module provides a way for admins to build an application/form using LWC's. This is accomplished by building a skeleton structure of your application using the custom objects: ```Reference_Application__c, Reference_Application_Section__c, Reference_Application_Detail__c```. The individual instances of an application are represented using the following custom objects: ```Application__c, Application_Section__c, Application_Detail__c```. 

Below is a basic ERD of the objects involved.
